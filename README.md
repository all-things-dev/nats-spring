# Spring Boot for NATS

Spring Boot for NATS provides abstractions for implementing NATS in Spring Boot applications.

TIP: This project is inspired by [Spring Kafka](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka) and
[Spring Pulsar](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-pulsar) and thus tries to closely match their implementation style.
